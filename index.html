      <p>
        <strong>Jupiter</strong> is the fifth planet from the Sun and the
        largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass
        one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the
        other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the
        brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has
        been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history.

      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <img src="img/saturn.jpg" alt="saturn" />
      <p>
        <strong>Saturn</strong> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
        second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant
        with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has
        one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
        volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the
        Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄)
        represents the god's sickle.

      <h2>Uranus and Neptune</h2>
      <img src="img/uranus-neptune.jpg" alt="uranus-neptune" />
      <p>
        <strong>Uranus and Neptune</strong> are the two most distant known major
        planets in our solar system. Both are now considered ice giants. Both
        are fundamentally different from the larger gas giants Jupiter and
        Saturn, and from smaller rocky worlds like Earth. Uranus and Neptune
        have similar masses and internal compositions. Their outer atmospheres
        are composed of hydrogen, helium and methane, while their mantles are a
        combination of water, ammonia and methane ices, and their cores are a
        mix of rock and ice.
